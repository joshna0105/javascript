Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data
types. Explain with some examples.
Datatype:-
-> datatype used to mention what kind of data used in the variable.

Types of datatypes:-
1.primitive datatype:- It can store single values.
		    ->They are default.
Example:-String  , number , Boolean , null ,undefined
2.Non-primitive datatype :- It can store multiple values.
			-> They are user defined.
			->mutable
Example:- functions, arrays , objects ,class

//find the max num among the given
let a=20;
let b=30;
let c=40;
